The QuickHealthCheck app is a basic app based on the US National Institutes of Health web page:

The app is self-explanatory as to what you should do, and what the results are.

Basically, it requires that you input some personal data (weight, height, waist circumference, and sex) -using the specified units (International metric units) when applicable.

Afterwards you should click on the Submit button.

The app will compute and display your Body Mass Index (weigth / (height)^2), which will provide insight regarding your weight condition, which will also be displayed along with your obesity class, should your results be aplicable.
Furthermore, combining BMI with your sex and waist circumference, the app will show which is your type 2-diabetes, hypertension and cardivascular disease risk (relative to normal weight and waist circumference) 

There is also a link to the information source, should the user need further information.
